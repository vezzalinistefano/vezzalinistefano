👋 Hi there!

My name is Stefano Vezzalini, I'm a DevOps engineer living in Italy.

I like to build and deploy in the cloud but I don't mind doing things the old fashioned way if it's needed,
I'm really fascinated by Linux and the open source world and I try my best in contributing to the software community.

I'm currently intrested in Cloud Native, platoform engineering distributed system and everything related.

In my free time I like to distro hop, play games, punch people (I'm an MMA and Kickboxing amateur), listen
to music and watch (never enough) movies.

My main machine is powered by Arch Linux, I like to build and maintain my desktop environments from scratch,
If you are intrested in tiling window managers, editor-based editors (~_nvim is the best editor btw_) and heavy Linux customization
you can find my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/vezzalinistefano/dotfiles) feel free to take inspiration from them!
